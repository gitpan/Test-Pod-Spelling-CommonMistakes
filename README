NAME
    Test::Pod::Spelling::CommonMistakes - Checks POD for common spelling
    mistakes

VERSION
      This document describes v1.000 of Test::Pod::Spelling::CommonMistakes - released February 21, 2011 as part of Test-Pod-Spelling-CommonMistakes.

SYNOPSIS
            #!/usr/bin/perl
            use strict; use warnings;

            use Test::More;

            eval "use Test::Pod::Spelling::CommonMistakes";
            if ( $@ ) {
                    plan skip_all => 'Test::Pod::Spelling::CommonMistakes required for testing POD';
            } else {
                    all_pod_files_ok();
            }

DESCRIPTION
    This module checks your POD for common spelling errors. This differs
    from Test::Spelling because it doesn't use your system spellchecker and
    instead uses Pod::Spell::CommonMistakes for the heavy lifting. Using it
    is the same as any standard Test::* module, as seen here.

METHODS
  all_pod_files_ok( [ @files ] )
    This function is what you will usually run. It automatically finds any
    POD in your distribution and runs checks on them.

    Accepts an optional argument: an array of files to check. By default it
    checks all POD files it can find in the distribution. Every file it
    finds is passed to the "pod_file_ok()" function.

  pod_file_ok( $file, [ $name ] )
    "pod_file_ok()" will okay the test if there is spelling errors present
    in the POD. Furthermore, if the POD was malformed as reported by
    Pod::Simple, the test will fail and not attempt to check spelling.

    When it fails, "pod_file_ok()" will show any misspelled words and their
    suggested spelling as diagnostics.

    The optional second argument $name is the name of the test. If it is
    omitted, "pod_file_ok()" chooses a default test name "Spelling test for
    $file".

EXPORT
    Automatically exports the two subs.
